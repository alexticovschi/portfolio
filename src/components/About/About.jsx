          From the moment I was able to finish my first project, I knew I was
          hooked into the world of web development. Web development has never
          been "just a passion" for me.It has offered an engaging challenge to
          continuously learn and improve my skills in creating better websites
          or web apps.

        <p>
          What started with just a curiosity of building something has become a
          full-fledged passion that only makes me more interested as the years
          go by.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am a motivated developer with skills in HTML5, CSS3, Sass,
          JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, React, Gatsby.js, Next.js, Node.js,
          MongoDB, MySQL. Iâ€™m also confident with numerous backend frameworks
          including Laravel, API & PHP development. My keen interest in
          development affords investing my spare time to further my skill set
          with interests in e-Commerce platforms like Shopify and other
          languages such as Python.
